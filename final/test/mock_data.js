        "description": "Pink Floyd live at Knebworth (1990) Rest in peace, Richard Wright (28 July 1943 - 15 September 2008), Syd Barrett (6 January 1946 7 July 2006) Remember when you were young, You shone like the sun. Shine on you crazy diamond. Now there's a look in your eyes, Like black holes in the sky. Shine on you crazy diamond. You were caught on the crossfire Of childhood and stardom, Blown on the steel breeze. Come on you target for faraway laughter, Come on you stranger, you legend, you martyr, and shine! You reached for the secret too soon, You cried for the moon. Shine on you crazy diamond. Threatened by shadows at night, And exposed in the light. Shine on you crazy diamond. Well you wore out your welcome With random precision, Rode on the steel breeze. Come on you raver, you seer of visions, Come on you painter, you piper, you prisoner, and shine!",

Roger Waters, one of the the composers of Time, is not in this show. Current members of Pink Floyd are: David Gilmour (guitars, lead vocals) • Richard Wright(keyboards, secondary vocals, backing vocals) • Nick Mason(drums, percussion); Lyrics: Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day You fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town Waiting for someone or something to show you the way Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today And then one day you find ten years have got behind you No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun And you run and you run to catch up with the sun, but it's sinking And racing around to come up behind you again The sun is the same in a relative way, but you're older Shorter of breath and one day closer to death Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way The time has gone, the song is over, thought I'd something more to say Home, home again I like to be here when I can When I come home cold and tired It's good to warm my bones beside the fire Far away across the <b>...</b>",

        "description": "*Lyrics* Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day You fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way. Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town Waiting for someone or something to show you the way. Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain. You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today. And then one day you find ten years have got behind you. No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun. So you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking Racing around to come up behind you again. The sun is the same in a relative way but you're older, Shorter of breath and one day closer to death. Every year is getting shorter never seem to find the time. Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way The time is gone, the song is over, Thought I'd something more to say. Home, home again I like to be here when I can And when I come home cold and tired Its good to warm my bones beside the fire Far away across the field The tolling of the iron bell Calls the faithful to their knees To hear the softly spoken magic spells. Please tell me songs that you would like me to put on they must be classic rock. Just post a channel comment here is how to do it. Name of song: Name of artist: Just fill that out thanks",

        "description": "Pink floyd - Comfortably Numb Lyrics: Hello? Is there anybody in there? Just nod if you can hear me. Is there anyone at home? Come on, now, I hear you're feeling down. Well I can ease your pain And get you on your feet again. Relax. I need some information first. Just the basic facts Can you show me where it hurts? There is no pain you are receding A distant ship, smoke on the horizon. You are only coming through in waves. Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying. When I was a child I had a fever My hands felt just like two balloons. Now I've got that feeling once again I can't explain you would not understand This is not how I am. I have become comfortably numb. (solo) I have become comfortably numb. OK Just a little pin prick. There'll be no more AHHHHHHHHHHHHH! But you may feel a little sick. Can you stand up? I do believe its working. Good. That'll keep you going through the show Come on it's time to go. There is no pain you are receding A distant ship, smoke on the horizon. You are only coming through in waves. Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying. When I was a child I caught a fleeting glimpse Out of the corner of my eye I turned to look but it was gone I cannot put my finger on it now The child is grown, The dream is gone. I have become comfortably numb.",

        "description": "HIT SUBSCRIBE FOR MORE CLASSIC VIDEOS Pink Floyd - Another Brick In The Wall Lifted from \"Pink Floyd The Wall\" film, this video is actually comprised of two songs: \"The Happiest Days Of Our Lives\" and \"Another Brick In The Wall Pt. 2\" This video became the official video of \"Another Brick In The Wall Pt. 2\" after the release of the film in 1982. This single is by far Pink Floyd's greatest ever mainstream success, instantly attaining classic status, and is perhaps their most famous piece of work. ABINTW Pt. 2 even became the protest song of a group of South African students during the apartheid regime, the song was subsequently banned in South Africa. The song itself is a protest against the rigidity of British schools, and in particular, the boarding school system Waters would have been part of as a young boy. The poem read out by the schoolteacher is a direct reference to \"Money\" The schoolteacher in this video was portrayed by the late, great, Scottish actor Alex McAvoy who passed away in June 2005. If you haven't seen \"The Wall\" I would Highly recommend you to do so.",

        "description": "\"Coming Back To Life\"... Where were you when I was burned and broken While the days slipped by from my window watching Where were you when I was hurt and helpless Because the things you say and the things you do surround me While you were hanging yourself on someone else's words Dying to believe in what you heard I was staring straight into the shining sun Lost in thought and lost in time While the seeds of lifeand the seeds of change were planted Outside the rain fell dark and slow While I pondered on this dangerous but irresistible pastime I took a heavenly ride through our silence I knew the moment had arrived For killing the past and coming back to life I took a heavenly ride through our silence I knew the waiting had begun And headed straight..into the shining sun",

Guys, I know this isn't the original album cover, but I think it's an amazing picture, and I believe it represents Pink Floyd's legacy and success throughout these years. This song was posted as a tribute to Syd Barrett. So, so you think you can tell Heaven from Hell, Blue skys from pain. Can you tell a green field From a cold steel rail? A smile from a veil? Do you think you can tell? And did they get you to trade Your heros for ghosts? Hot ashes for trees? Hot air for a cool breeze? Cold comfort for change? And did you exchange A walk on part in the war For a lead role in a cage? How I wish, how I wish you were here. We're just two lost souls Swimming in a fish bowl, Year after year, Running over the same old ground. What have we found? The same old fears. Wish you were here. __________________________ I do not own anything.",

This song was edited out of the film for fear on the part of the filmmakers that the film was running too long; however, a rough version is available as an extra on the 25th anniversary edition DVD. Lyrics: Hey you ! out there in the cold Getting lonely, getting old, can you feel me Hey you ! Standing in the aisles With itchy feet and fading smiles, can you feel me Hey you ! don't help them to bury the light Don't give in without a fight. Hey you ! out there on your own sitting naked by the phone would you touch me Hey you ! with your ear against the wall Waiting for someone to call out would you touch me Hey you ! would you help me to carry the stone Open your heart, I'm coming home But it was only a fantasy The wall was too high as you can see No matter how he tried he could not break free And the worms ate into his brain. Hey you ! out there on the road Always doing what you're told, can you help me Hey you ! out there beyond the wall Breaking bottles in the hall, can you help me Hey you ! don't tell me there's no hope at all Together we stand, divided we fall.",

Shine on you crazy diamond. Now there's a look in your eyes, Like black holes in the sky. Shine on you crazy diamond. You were caught on the crossfire Of childhood and stardom, Blown on the steel breeze. Come on you target for faraway laughter, Come on you stranger, you legend, you martyr, and shine! You reached for the secret too soon, You cried for the moon. Shine on you crazy diamond. Threatened by shadows at night, And exposed in the light. Shine on you crazy diamond. Well you wore out your welcome With random precision, Rode on the steel breeze. Come on you raver, you seer of visions, Come on you painter, you piper, you prisoner, and shine!",

Roger Waters, one of the the composers of Time, is not in this show. Current members of Pink Floyd are: David Gilmour (guitars, lead vocals) • Richard Wright(keyboards, secondary vocals, backing vocals) • Nick Mason(drums, percussion); Lyrics: Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day You fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town Waiting for someone or something to show you the way Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today And then one day you find ten years have got behind you No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun And you run and you run to catch up with the sun, but it's sinking And racing around to come up behind you again The sun is the same in a relative way, but you're older Shorter of breath and one day closer to death Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way The time has gone, the song is over, thought I'd something more to say Home, home again I like to be here when I can When I come home cold and tired It's good to warm my bones beside the fire Far away across the <b>...</b>",

    "description": "These are the two parts of ''Echoes'' ,at the Pompeii , in one video .. 24'06'' Enjoy :-) \"Echoes\" Overhead the albatross hangs motionless upon the air And deep beneath the rolling waves in labyrinths of coral caves The echo of a distant tide Comes willowing across the sand And everything is green and submarine And no one showed us to the land And no one knows the where's or why's But something stirs and something tries And starts to climb towards the light Strangers passing in the street By chance two separate glances meet And I am you and what I see is me And do I take you by the hand And lead you through the land And help me understand the best I can And no one calls us to move on And no one forces down our eyes And no one speaks And no one tries And no one flies around the sun Cloudless every day you fall Upon my waking eyes Inviting and inciting me to rise And through the window in the wall Comes streaming in on sunlight wings A million bright ambassadors of morning And no one sings me lullabies And no one makes me close my eyes So I tore the windows wide And call to you across the sky.",

    "description": "*Lyrics* Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day You fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way. Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town Waiting for someone or something to show you the way. Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain. You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today. And then one day you find ten years have got behind you. No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun. So you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking Racing around to come up behind you again. The sun is the same in a relative way but you're older, Shorter of breath and one day closer to death. Every year is getting shorter never seem to find the time. Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way The time is gone, the song is over, Thought I'd something more to say. Home, home again I like to be here when I can And when I come home cold and tired Its good to warm my bones beside the fire Far away across the field The tolling of the iron bell Calls the faithful to their knees To hear the softly spoken magic spells. Please tell me songs that you would like me to put on they must be classic rock. Just post a channel comment here is how to do it. Name of song: Name of artist: Just fill that out thanks",

    "description": "Pink floyd - Comfortably Numb Lyrics: Hello? Is there anybody in there? Just nod if you can hear me. Is there anyone at home? Come on, now, I hear you're feeling down. Well I can ease your pain And get you on your feet again. Relax. I need some information first. Just the basic facts Can you show me where it hurts? There is no pain you are receding A distant ship, smoke on the horizon. You are only coming through in waves. Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying. When I was a child I had a fever My hands felt just like two balloons. Now I've got that feeling once again I can't explain you would not understand This is not how I am. I have become comfortably numb. (solo) I have become comfortably numb. OK Just a little pin prick. There'll be no more AHHHHHHHHHHHHH! But you may feel a little sick. Can you stand up? I do believe its working. Good. That'll keep you going through the show Come on it's time to go. There is no pain you are receding A distant ship, smoke on the horizon. You are only coming through in waves. Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying. When I was a child I caught a fleeting glimpse Out of the corner of my eye I turned to look but it was gone I cannot put my finger on it now The child is grown, The dream is gone. I have become comfortably numb.",

    "description": "HIT SUBSCRIBE FOR MORE CLASSIC VIDEOS Pink Floyd - Another Brick In The Wall Lifted from \"Pink Floyd The Wall\" film, this video is actually comprised of two songs: \"The Happiest Days Of Our Lives\" and \"Another Brick In The Wall Pt. 2\" This video became the official video of \"Another Brick In The Wall Pt. 2\" after the release of the film in 1982. This single is by far Pink Floyd's greatest ever mainstream success, instantly attaining classic status, and is perhaps their most famous piece of work. ABINTW Pt. 2 even became the protest song of a group of South African students during the apartheid regime, the song was subsequently banned in South Africa. The song itself is a protest against the rigidity of British schools, and in particular, the boarding school system Waters would have been part of as a young boy. The poem read out by the schoolteacher is a direct reference to \"Money\" The schoolteacher in this video was portrayed by the late, great, Scottish actor Alex McAvoy who passed away in June 2005. If you haven't seen \"The Wall\" I would Highly recommend you to do so.",

Where were you when I was burned and broken While the days slipped by from my window watching Where were you when I was hurt and helpless Because the things you say and the things you do surround me While you were hanging yourself on someone else's words Dying to believe in what you heard I was staring straight into the shining sun Lost in thought and lost in time While the seeds of lifeand the seeds of change were planted Outside the rain fell dark and slow While I pondered on this dangerous but irresistible pastime I took a heavenly ride through our silence I knew the moment had arrived For killing the past and coming back to life I took a heavenly ride through our silence I knew the waiting had begun And headed straight..into the shining sun",

    "description": "THE LYRICS ARE HERE, PEOPLE, SO PLEASE DON'T ASK! Guys, I know this isn't the original album cover, but I think it's an amazing picture, and I believe it represents Pink Floyd's legacy and success throughout these years. This song was posted as a tribute to Syd Barrett. So, so you think you can tell Heaven from Hell, Blue skys from pain. Can you tell a green field From a cold steel rail? A smile from a veil? Do you think you can tell? And did they get you to trade Your heros for ghosts? Hot ashes for trees? Hot air for a cool breeze? Cold comfort for change? And did you exchange A walk on part in the war For a lead role in a cage? How I wish, how I wish you were here. We're just two lost souls Swimming in a fish bowl, Year after year, Running over the same old ground. What have we found? The same old fears. Wish you were here. __________________________ I do not own anything.",

    "title": "Pink Floyd-Hey You (Lyrics)",
    "description": "\"Hey You\" is a song by the English progressive rock band Pink Floyd. It was released on The Wall album in 1979. It starts the second disc of the double album. This song was edited out of the film for fear on the part of the filmmakers that the film was running too long; however, a rough version is available as an extra on the 25th anniversary edition DVD. Lyrics: Hey you ! out there in the cold Getting lonely, getting old, can you feel me Hey you ! Standing in the aisles With itchy feet and fading smiles, can you feel me Hey you ! don't help them to bury the light Don't give in without a fight. Hey you ! out there on your own sitting naked by the phone would you touch me Hey you ! with your ear against the wall Waiting for someone to call out would you touch me Hey you ! would you help me to carry the stone Open your heart, I'm coming home But it was only a fantasy The wall was too high as you can see No matter how he tried he could not break free And the worms ate into his brain. Hey you ! out there on the road Always doing what you're told, can you help me Hey you ! out there beyond the wall Breaking bottles in the hall, can you help me Hey you ! don't tell me there's no hope at all Together we stand, divided we fall.",

    "description": "Pink realises the mistake he made completely shunning society, and attempts to regain contact with the outside world. However, he cannot see or hear beyond the wall. Pink's call becomes more and more desperate as he begins to realize there is no escape. Lyrics : Hey you, out there in the cold Getting lonely, getting old Can you feel me? Hey you, standing in the aisles With itchy feet and fading smiles Can you feel me? Hey you, dont help them to bury the light Don't give in without a fight. Hey you, out there on your own Sitting naked by the phone Would you touch me? Hey you, with you ear against the wall Waiting for someone to call out Would you touch me? Hey you, would you help me to carry the stone? Open your heart, I'm coming home. But it was only fantasy. The wall was too high, As you can see. No matter how he tried, He could not break free. And the worms ate into his brain. Hey you, out there on the road always doing what you're told, Can you help me? Hey you, out there beyond the wall, Breaking bottles in the hall, Can you help me? Hey you, don't tell me there's no hope at all Together we stand, divided we fall.",
